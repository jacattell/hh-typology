# hh-typology
Visualizing household balance sheets during the last recession (2007-2011) using the Bank of England household survey

#First steps: data summary
1. Identify variables appropriate for clustering, summarize
2. Identify variables for visualization: balance sheet variables (secured/unsecured debt), summarize
3. Identify subset of households which are longitudinal across the years (sample size?)
4. Identify complete cases (set of households with no missing values for the variables of interest)
